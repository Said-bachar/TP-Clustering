# TP-Clustering
Using diffrent clustering methods on 2d and 3d datasets

***
The goal of these project is to implement and compare different clustering algorithms first from a few methods provided by scikitlearn then using an external method:
* k-Means
* hierarchical clustering (agglomerative)
* DBSCAN
* HDBSCAN
***
N.B : 
* The artificiels datatset used in the first part are available [here] (https://github.com/deric/clustering-benchmark)
* In the second part we used tha datasets availablein the 'dataset' folder.
